# Portfolio site

This is (going to be) my portfolio site. It's currently very much a skeleton to have something to build on.

It's deployed on a Google Compute Engine VM and accessible at [nikkola.dev](https://www.nikkola.dev).

What I might do next:

- [ ] Build a deployment system with Kubernetes to make it easier to host multiple projects on the same VM.
- [ ] add more content
    - [ ] projects
    - [ ] CV
